	META Spectator is a component that allows for a creator to easily implement spectating other players, whether it be
	attached to a player or freecam. Customization being a priority, there are many custom properties to edit.


1.	Setup

	1)	Drag-and-drop the template into the hierarchy
	2)	(CAN BE SKIPPED) Drag your default player setting into the appropriate custom property
	3)	Adjust custom properties as you wish!


2.	Usage

	Each custom property has ToolTips explaining what it alters.
